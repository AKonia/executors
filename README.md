This repository contains a proposal for standardizing executors for C++. This proposal is separated into two parts:

* A [design document](explanatory.md) explaining the proposal's programming model for executors (published as [P0761](http://wg21.link/P0761))
* A [technical document](wording.md) containing a formal description of the programming model (published as [P0443](http://wg21.link/P0443))

A [prototype implementation](https://github.com/executors/executors-impl) is also available.
