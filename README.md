This repository contains a proposal for standardizing executors for C++. This proposal is separated into two parts:

* A [design document](explanatory.md) explaining the proposal's programming model for executors
* A [technical document](wording.md) containing a formal description of the programming model

A [prototype implementation](rebind_prototype) is also included.
