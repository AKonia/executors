Abstract:           This paper proposes a programming model for executors, which are modular components for creating execution. The design of this proposal is described in paper [P0761](https://wg21.link/P0761).

### Changes since R0

* Executor category simplification
* Specified executor customization points in detail
* Introduced new fine-grained executor type traits
    * Detectors for execution functions
    * Traits for introspecting cross-cutting concerns
        * Introspection of mapping of agents to threads
        * Introspection of execution function blocking behavior
* Allocator support for single agent execution functions
* Renamed `thread_pool` to `static_thread_pool`
* New introduction

### Changes since R1

* Separated wording from explanatory prose, now contained in paper [P0761](https://wg21.link/P0761)
